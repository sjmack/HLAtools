\title{Determine if an allele name is properly formed and present in HLAalignments}
\usage{
validateAllele(allele)
}
\arguments{
\item{allele}{A colon-delimited HLA allele name.}
}
\value{
A logical identifying if the allele name is present in the alignments (TRUE) or, if it is not in the alignments or is not valid not (FALSE).
}
\description{
Returns TRUE if an allele name is found in HLAalignments in either the 'allele_name' column of full-length allele names or the 'trimmed_allele' column of two-field allele names in the pertinent genomic alignment. Returns FALSE if the allele name is not properly formed, or if the allele name is not found in HLAalignments.
}
\note{
Messages will be returned to the console if the allele name is malformed, or the locus is invalid.

The locus being evaluated must be included in HLAalignments.
