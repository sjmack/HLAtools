## HLAtools: Functions and Datasets for Human Leukocyte Antigen Informatics

## Version 0.7.7.9000

The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region is the most polymorphic section of the human genome, with 38,008 allelic variants identified across 46 loci. The key roles played by the class I and class II HLA genes in stem-cell therapy and transplantation, HLA and disease association research, evolutionary biology, and population genetics results in constant discovery of new allele variants. These data are curated and maintained by the [IPD-IMGT/HLA Database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/) and made available on the [ANHIG/IMGTHLA GitHub repository](https://github.com/ANHIG/IMGTHLA) as static text files, which are updated every three months. Standardized use of the data in this key resource can be challenging. To address this, we have developed HLAtools, an R package that automates the consumption of IMGT-IMGT/HLA resources, and renders them computable.   

HLAtools makes computable versions of alignments in the IPD-IMHT/HLA Database available alongside a suite of functions that foster computation on them. The package includes a 'gazetteer' that defines specific categories of genes supported by the IPD-IMGT/HLA Database, an 'atlas' that identifies the boundaries between gene features (exons, introns and untranslated regions) at each gene, pseudogene and gene fragment, a bespoke guide to the non-standard features found in some gene fragments, and a computable index of the [names of all HLA alleles](https://github.com/ANHIG/IMGTHLA/tree/Latest/allelelist) for all IPD-IMGT/HLA Database release versions. These resources can be updated with each new IPD-IMGT/HLA Database release. The package also includes a guide to the genes supported by the IPD-IMGT/HLA Database. Package functions allow the identification of sequence differences between alleles at a given gene, construction of customized peptide, codon, nucleotide and genomic alignments for specific alleles at user-specified positions (including alleles at different loci), validation, trimming and conversion of HLA allele names across IPD-IMGT/HLA database releases, and conversion between [GL String](https://glstring.org) and [UNIFORMAT](https://hla-net.eu/tools/uniformate/) data formats.
